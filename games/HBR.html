            <b><i>Prologue</b></i> focus on introducing our main cast and is relatively standard. You learn  each character quirks and gimmick.
            </p>
            <p>
            <b><i>Chapter 1</i></b> this focus on squad 31-C  and gives the player a test of how the world and story isn't all happiness and sunshine.
            </p>
            <p>
            <b><i>Chapter 2</i></b> Focuses on squad 31-B. This chapter suffers from extended filler battles and drawn out side plot lines but it's also gives Ruka the much needed character development. If you're able to finish this chapter and get to chapter 3 you're in for a treat.
            </p>
            <p>
            <b><i>Chapter 3</i></b> Focuses  on squad 30-G. If you made it to this chapter, the story really starts getting good here. We get mystery and very important word building, and they learn from chapter 2 and remove all the needlessly long battles dragging the story down in the last chapter.
